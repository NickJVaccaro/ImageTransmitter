# Image Transmitter

This project uses NodeJS and a very basic AngularJS front-end to select an image on one computer/devie and have it automatically display on another computer/device.

To run it, simply run "node index" at the root.

To set an image, navigate to "localhost:3000/setImage.html".

To view an image, navigate to "localhost:3000/getImage.html".
